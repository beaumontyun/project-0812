    <h1>How do I show support?</h1>
    <p>
      You can show us support for free by signing up to our email and updates
      list or you can invest in us directly and own a piece of Hands Off by
      buying some Governance Tokens.
    </p>
    <h1>Why do you need me to sign up?</h1>
    <p>
      Right now we are in the process of showing off this concept to raise funds
      so we can make this platform publicly ready. We need you to sign up so we
      can show the world that this is something people want. Also just signing
      up gives us the encouragement to know that we are doing something that
      people like and want. So it makes us feel good about what we are doing
      too!
    </p>
    <h1>What happens after you get 10,000 sign ups?</h1>
    <p>
      This is the number of sign ups we think we need to guarantee that we can
      make this a reality!
    </p>
    <h1>When do you think this is going to happen?</h1>
    <p>
      Right now we have all the manufacturing and technology lined up. All we
      need is to prove to the world that this is something you want and once we
      have enough people sign up we think we can get this up and running (in
      stages) within 3-6 months.
    </p>
    <h1>What is different about Hands Off?</h1>
    <p>
      We are the only marketplace that charges zero commission on sales because
      we think that being a creator is hard enough as it is. You don’t need us
      to take commission from you too. Making this the best creator, buyer &
      seller platform available.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are also the only marketplace that can create and list both digital and
      physical assets that have been NFT’d. Letting us potentially gather the
      most creative collectables and assets in one place. And offer the most
      selection possible for users.
    </p>
    <h1>Why are we doing 0% commission?</h1>
    <p>
      We don’t believe in making money from the creations of others, so we don’t
      take any commission from buyers or sellers. We also want to create a
      marketplace where people can connect with one another and trade with each
      other freely without the worry of hidden costs because with us there
      aren’t any.
    </p>
    <h1>How do you make this a sustainable business?</h1>
    <p>
      We are a marketplace that sustains itself by helping promote and market
      its creators and users. We will also offer metaverse value add services
      that can help users build out bigger, better, cooler looking 3D galleries
      to showcase their assets.
    </p>
    <h1>How is this a metaverse?</h1>
    <p>
      Think of the metaverse as a virtual and 3D capable country where users can
      interact with one another. What we are is an interactive marketplace that
      has 3D metaverse capabilities where users can create a virtual gallery
      from their portfolio to show the rest of the world their assets.
    </p>
    <h1>What if I don’t want to be in the metaverse?</h1>
    <p>
      Our platform is metaverse capable meaning you can still enjoy the
      commission free environment inside and outside of the metaverse.
    </p>
    <h1>Can I get some more information about you?</h1>
    <p>
      Of course you can! You can download more detailed information about us
      from our “Documentation” page. If you can’t find what you are looking for
      also feel free to email us directly.
